# "Continuous Integration 1, 2, 3" Exercise

## Learning Objectives

  + Learn how to configure an application's automated tests to be run on a continuous integration server.
  + Practice techniques for preventing bugs and undesired application functionality from reaching end users.

## Prerequisites

  + ["Testing 1, 2, 3" Exercise](/exercises/testing-123.md)
  + [Travis CI](/notes/travis-ci.md)

## Setup

Start following the [tutorial](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/#to-get-started-with-travis-ci) to integrate Travis CI with your GitHub account.

If you haven't yet completed the ["Testing 1, 2, 3" Exercise](/exercises/testing-123.md), take a moment to do that now. We'll build on that application for the purposes of this exercise. Our goal is to configure a remote repository to run automated tests whenever we propose a change to this application's source code.

Navigate to the "testing-123" directory from the command line, and open it with a text editor. Verify your ability to run its tests before moving on:

```sh
cd path/to/testing-123 # or some other path to your repo

pytest
```

Great, the local directory is looking good. Let's take a moment to create a new remote repository on GitHub where we will push this code to. When creating a new remote repository, you should see the option to grant repo access to Travis CI platform. Ensure this option is selected!

As a final setup step, initialize a new Git repository in your local "testing-123" directory, then associate that local repository with the remote repository's remote address:

```sh
git init .
git add .
git commit -m "My first commit"

git remote add origin YOUR_REPOS_REMOTE_ADDRESS
git push origin master
```

> NOTE: if you see an error like "", you may have to do a "forced" push with `git push origin master -f`.

You should now be able to see your code reflected on GitHub.

Follow [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/enabling-required-status-checks) to designate the "master" branch as a protected branch, and "enable status checks" for the remote repository. Add a "branch protection rule" with a name pattern of "master", and enable the "Require status checks to pass before merging" and "Require branches to be up to date before merging" settings:

## Configuration

Continue following the Travis CI tutorial by adding a special configuration file called ".travis.yml" to the root directory of your repository, and place inside the following contents:

```yml
dist: xenial
language: python
python:
  - "3.7"
install:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
script:
  - pytest
```

This file will instruct the CI server to use a specific version of python, install package dependencies, and run tests.

> NOTE: The `dist: xenial` setting is necessary at this time for installation of Python version 3.7, and the `install: pip install -r requirements.txt` setting is only necessary if there are packages to install, so you can omit the "install" setting for this application. Pytest should already be automatically installed on the CI server, so there isn't a need to install it again via Pip.

Commit this new configuration file to the version history:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Configure Travis CI"
```

## Deploying

Push your local code up to the remote repository, and then verify this triggers the execution of tests on the CI server.

```sh
git push origin master
```
