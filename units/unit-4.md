# Unit 4 Agenda

## Objectives

In this unit, we'll illustrate the concept of **program-data independence** as we explore integrations between software and datastores. We'll focus on the Comma-separated Values (CSV) data format and learn how to use Python to process CSV data.

## Slides

## Discussions and Notes

  + Program-Data Independence
  + Datastores, Databases, and CSV Files
  + [File Management](/notes/python/file-management.md)
  + Processing CSV Data in Python:
    + [The `csv` Module](/notes/python/modules/csv.md)


> FYI: We're using a CSV file datastore here for simplicity. If you already know SQL, you might be interested to know you can use Python to connect to relational databases as well. Consider further exploring the following packages for examples:
>
>    + [The `psycopg` Package](/notes/python/packages/psycopg.md) (for PostgreSQL databases)
>    + [The `pymysql` Package](/notes/python/packages/pymysql.md) (for MySQL databases)

## Activities and Exercises

  + ["Grocery Store Expansion" Exercise](/exercises/grocery-store-expansion.md)
