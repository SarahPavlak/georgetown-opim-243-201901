# "Exec Dash" Further Exploration Challenges

If you'd like to address any of these challenges, you can feel free to do so in a separate Python script, different than the one you used for the basic requirements. If you do, update your repository's README file to include corresponding usage instructions.

## Challenge 1: Compare Sales Across Months

Expand the scope of this project to import multiple monthly sales CSV files and compare sales across months. Which months have the highest sales? Lowest? What is the trend of sales over time?

Visualize the sales over time using a column or bar chart with time on the x axis and sales on the y axis.

![bar chart of sales month over month](#TODO)

> HINT: for processing all CSV files, try using the `os` module to detect the names of all CSV files which exist in the "data" directory, and loop through each one at a time, processing its data and either storing the results in memory or to a separate CSV file.

## Challenge 2: Predicting Future Sales

> WARNING: only for advanced students with experience in statistics and/or machine learning. For other students, this might be a good "freestyle" project idea to revisit later...

Expand the scope of this project to predict what the total sales will be for any given product during any given month within the next year.
