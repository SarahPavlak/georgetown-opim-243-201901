## Submission Instructions

To submit:

  1. Push your local project repository to GitHub, so you can visit your remote project repository at a URL like `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO`.
  2. Fork the ["upstream" course repository](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-243-201901) (or refresh your existing fork).
  3. Update your forked course repository's ["Freestyle" Submissions CSV file](freestyle/submissions.csv).
to include your GitHub username and your project repository's URL.
