# "Freestyle" Project Implementation

> Prerequisite: ["Freestyle" Project Description](/projects/freestyle.md)

## Instructions

After producing a written [Planning and Requirements Document](/projects/freestyle/requirements.md), it's time to write application software in the Python programming language to implement your proposed solution.

## Submission Instructions

To submit:

  1. Push your local project repository to GitHub, so you can visit your remote project repository at a URL like `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO`.
  2. Fork the ["upstream" course repository](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-243-201901) (or refresh your existing fork).
  3. Update your forked course repository's ["Freestyle" Submissions CSV file](freestyle/submissions.csv).
to include your GitHub username and your project repository's URL.
  4. Submit a Pull Request for your forked course repository's changes to be accepted into the "upstream" course repository.

## Evaluation

Implementations will be evaluated based on the criteria below:

Category | Requirement | Weight
--- | --- | ---

Uniqueness and Individuality | Exhibits creativity, and a unique set of functionality | 10%
Repository Requirements | Includes a README file w/ clear and comprehensive installation and usage instructions | 12%
User Experience | Provides a simple, pleasant, and intuitive experience for the user, free of idiosyncrasies | 15%
Code Quality | Reflects a reasonable degree of codebase maintainability, including descriptive comments and absence of code duplication | 15%
Automated Tests | Includes automated tests which verify the application's ability to function as desired | 15%
Continuous Integration | Configures automated tests to be run on a CI server before a new feature is deployed / merged, to help prevent bugs from reaching the end user | 5%
Dev Process | Submitted via remote Git repository which reflects an incremental revision history and contributions from all team members | 20%

This rubric is tentative, and may be subject to slight adjustments during the grading process.
