# "Freestyle" Project Planning and Requirements Document

> Prerequisite: ["Freestyle" Project Description](/projects/freestyle.md)

## Instructions

Prepare a written document (in PDF format) which describes the results of your project planning, analysis, and design efforts. Let's refer to this the "Planning and Requirements Document".

Your project planning and requirements document should include information sufficient to convey _________. If you get stuck, try thinking about responses for each of the sections outlined below:

  + Problem Statement
    + User Needs
    + Current State Processes
    + Potential Solutions
  + Proposed Solution
    + System Objectives
    + Future State Processes
    + Information Requirements
    + Functionality Requirements
    + Interface Requirements
    + Technology Requirements

Include illustrations and diagrams as necessary. For illustrations and diagrams, you may include low-fidelity, hand-drawn images, but prefer to deliver higher-fidelity versions produced via a [digital diagramming tool](/notes/diagramming.md).

### Problem Statement

What problem would you like to solve, or what opportunity will you address? Why is it a problem? What is the impact of the problem?

#### User Needs

Who are the individuals affected by the problem? How are they impacted? How could their experience be improved? What are their needs? Please include language like: "[WHO] needs [WHAT] so that [WHY]".

#### Current State Processes

Describe the current state of the problematic process, and identify any pain points as applicable.

Include a diagram of the process. Let's refer to this as the "Current State Process Diagram".

#### Potential Solutions

Brainstorm a few potential solutions to the problem you've identified. Keep in mind, these solutions could be technical or non-technical in nature, and may or may not all involve application software. How can each of these potential solutions help the affected users? After identifying and describing a few potential solutions, compare the merits of each. If the best solution might not translate well into the objectives of this Python programming project, consider identifying a different problem which might lend itself more easily to being solved by a technology solution.

### Proposed Solution

Which solution are you proposing to implement, and why?

#### System Objectives

What are the goals or objectives of your proposed system? Please briefly describe the system's desired functionality at the highest possible level (e.g. "The system should send me an email every morning to share information about the day's weather forecast...").

#### Future State Processes

Describe the future state of the process to be implemented by your proposed solution, and identify any areas of simplification and automation.

Include a diagram of the process. Let's refer to this as the "Future State Process Diagram".

#### Information Requirements

Describe the system's information requirements, in terms of information inputs and outputs. What information inputs does the system require in order to achieve its desired functionality? Where do these inputs come from? What is the data format of these inputs? What information outputs does the system produce in the process of achieving its desired functionality? What will be the data format of these outputs?

Include a Data Flow Diagram to help illustrate these information requirements.

#### Functionality Requirements

Describe the system's functionality in greater detail. Decompose the system into various logical components and describe the desired functionality of each. Describe functionality in terms of desired user experience, as well as underlying system responsibilities.

#### Interface Requirements

Describe the mechanisms in which your users will interact with the system.

Include visual representations in the form of mockups, wireframes, flow-charts, storyboards, etc.

#### Technology Requirements

Which APIs, if any, does your system require in order to produce its desired functionality? What functionality do these APIs provide? Why are they necessary or helpful?

Which third-party Python packages, if any, does your system require in order to produce its desired functionality? What functionality do these packages provide? Why are they necessary or helpful?

Will your software be deployed to a remote server (i.e. web app or scheduled service)? Will your system need to integrate with other hardware like scanners and sensors? Describe these hardware integrations.

## Submission Instructions

Upload your PDF document [to Canvas](https://georgetown.instructure.com/courses/75384/assignments/203920).

Later, when you create a repository for the ["Freestyle" Project Implementation](/projects/freestyle/implementation.md), you're encouraged to also include this document in that repository in a subdirectory called "planning" or "design", and refer back to it as a guide for your development activities.

## Evaluation

Requirements documents will be evaluated on their ability to ______________________________:
