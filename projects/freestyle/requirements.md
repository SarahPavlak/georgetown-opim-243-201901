# "Freestyle" Project Planning and Requirements Document

> Prerequisite: ["Freestyle" Project Description](/projects/freestyle.md)

## Instructions

Prepare a written document (in PDF format) which describes the results of your project planning, analysis, and design efforts. Let's refer to this the "Planning and Requirements Document".

Your project planning and requirements document should include detailed responses for each of the sections outlined below:

  + Problem Statement
    + User Needs
    + Current State Processes
    + Potential Solutions
  + Proposed Solution
    + System Objectives
    + Future State Processes
    + Information Requirements
    + Functionality Requirements
    + Interface Requirements
    + Technology Requirements
    + Cost-benefit Analysis

The document should include embedded illustrations and diagrams as desired.

## Submission Instructions

Upload your PDF document [to Canvas](https://georgetown.instructure.com/courses/75384/assignments/203920).

Later, when you create a repository for the ["Freestyle" Project Implementation](/projects/freestyle/implementation.md), you're encouraged to also include this document in that repository in a subdirectory called "planning" or "design", and refer back to it as a guide for your development activities.
