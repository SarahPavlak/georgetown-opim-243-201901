# "Freestyle" Project Requirements

> Prerequisite: ["Freestyle" Project Description](/projects/freestyle.md)

## Instructions

Prepare a written document which describes the results of your project planning, analysis, and design efforts. Let's call this the "Requirements Document".


Your project planning and requirements document should include detailed responses for each of the sections outlined below:

  + Problem Statement:
    + People
    + Processes
  + Proposed Solution:
    + System Objectives
    + Information Requirements
    + Technology Requirements
    + Interface Requirements



















### Problem Statement

Provide a **description of the problem** your project is trying to solve, including **statements of user needs** and **descriptions of "as-is" and "to-be" processes**.

If you get stuck, think about the following questions:

  + Who are the application's primary users? NOTE: it's fine if you are the primary user.
  + What are the user's needs?
  + What problem does the application solve?

### Proposed Solution

Describe your proposed solution to the problem statement. At a high level, what should the software do?

### Information Requirements

Identify the application's **information inputs** and **information outputs**.

If you get stuck, think about the following questions:

  + What information inputs does the system require in order to achieve its desired functionality? Where do these inputs come from? What is the data format of these inputs?
  + What information outputs does the system produce in the process of achieving its desired functionality? What will be the data format of these outputs?


### Technology Requirements

Perform some preliminary research and investigation into how your proposed solution will work, and provide a written description of the results.

If you get stuck, think about the following questions:


  + What **APIs or web services**, if any, might your application require in order to produce its desired functionality? Have you read their documentation or tried using them? How is it going? Please include links to API docs.
  + What **third-party Python packages**, if any, might your application require in order to produce its desired functionality? For each package, have you read the  documentation or tried using it? How is it going? Please include links to package docs. You are also encouraged to include somewhere in your repository a file of Python code demonstrating your early-stage attempts to use the prerequisite package(s).
  + What **hardware** will your application run on? Your personal machine or some public server?



























## Submission Instructions

in markdown or PDF format


Create a new repository and place inside it a file called `PLANNING.md`, and place inside the following document template:


As you complete each of the requirements below, replace the "todo..." lines with real content resulting from your project planning efforts. For an example planning document, see the [professor's example project planning document](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/repo-evaluator-py/blob/master/PLANNING.md).
