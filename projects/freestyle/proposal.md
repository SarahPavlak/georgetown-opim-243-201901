# "Freestyle" Project Proposal

> Prerequisite: ["Freestyle" Project Description](/projects/freestyle.md)

As stated in the project description, you may work on this project independently, or with a partner. If you'd like to be paired with a random partner, please alert the professor as soon as possible, so he can match student pairs together with enough time to collaboratively brainstorm app ideas.

Whether working independently, with a partner of choice, or with an assigned partner, after brainstorming, each student should submit their own [Proposal Form](https://forms.gle/pa9dMBPheaSxfAgHA) before the designated due date. The form asks for information about your team composition and your proposed idea(s). Partners should mutually designate each other, and may submit the same or similar responses.

Don't worry if your responses are not the most fully formed. You'll later have a chance to further refine and elaborate in the [Project Planning and Requirements Document](/projects/freestyle/requirements.md).
