# Travis CI

> Make sure every Pull Request to your project is tested before it's merged.

> Travis CI makes it so much easier for us to coordinate the thousands of commits and contributors that flow through the Rails code base. The test suite for such a large project is vast, and we wouldn't be catching issues as quickly or smoothly without the help of Travis. - @dhh
